This project was completed for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification.
It fulfills the minimum requirements. So there aren't any media queries and minimal CSS styling, e.g., I excluded a hover state on the submit button.
I went with a retro design because I think that old video games are cool looking.
